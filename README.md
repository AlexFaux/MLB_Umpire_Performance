# <h1 align="center">MLB Umpires: Too Human?<project-name></h1>

## <p align="center">Are there any outside factors that seem to affect the performance of MLB umpires?
<p align="center">Controversy surrounding MLB umpires has been much more prevelant in recent times, specifically in the past decade, with the increasing popularity of a potential technology known colloquially as the 'robo ump.' This 'robo ump' uses the cameras in the stadium to establish a virtual strike zone that determines balls and strikes based on the location data of the ball as it crosses the plate.
<p align="center">This would turn a subjective call of balls and strikes into a purely¬†objective call.
<p align="center">I've taken a look at potential factors that could be having a noticeable effect on umpires' accuracy and/or consistency.<project-description></p>

## ü§ù Acknowledgements ü§ù

I want to shout out those who helped me along this 15 week process at NSS. I came into the program with a bit of a headstart compared to most of my coursemates, but I like to think I also helped out those who needed it. Everyone at Nashville Software School has been a HUGE help along this process. Without them none of us in DDA6 would be where we are 15 weeks later.

  - Our instructors: **Chris Wright, Josh Rio-Ross, Suzanne Saggio,** and **Olariche Obi**.
    - I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an easy person to teach. I've always preferred to teach myself stuff, which in most cases has worked out. In some cases though it definitely has not. One specific example where I used the instructors to my full advantage involved for loops in Python. Going into our first partner project I refused to use for loops because I just did not get them. After the project I asked **Josh** to take a look at my code and he was able to walk us all through the process of turning repetitive code into a for loop step by step. Now you can ask anyone in the class and they'll tell you I'm the guy to go to when it comes to loops.
    - There are plenty of times like that where each of them has made a complicated concept easy to understand. It's hard to put into words how much I and every one else appreciate that.
  
  - Next up is Career Dev extraordinaire, **Michael Frieh**.
    - The career development portion of our program was invaluable. Everything **Michael** went over is going to stick with us for a long time. None of it was superfluous information. While it's easier to put into words what **Michael** did for us, namely 3 rounds of resume reviews, mock interview setups, and panel discussions + lunch and learns with actual analysts and hiring managers around the Nashville area, the experience and information this all gave us was very valuable. He absolutely killed it and made the process as easy as possible.
  
  - **Haley** 'Zap' **Zapolski**
    - Zap makes sure we're all aware of potential job opportunitues, sending them to us as soon as she learns of them. I know for a fact that those have turned into interviews for some us, which means it's definitely working. Searching for jobs is such an annoying process. She makes it as easy as possible.
  
  - **Everyone else at NSS**
    - Nashville Software School provides an amazing service to the tech industry in and around Nashville. Without even attending the other courses I can guarantee they are just as great as the full-time Data Analytics course. Everyone that works with NSS, from the top-down, does so much work to ensure that we have the best experience possible. All of the thanks in the world goes out to every single person involved in that process.
  
  - **My coursemates**
    - I went into this program expecting to keep my head down and learn on my own. What happened couldn't have been further from the truth. One of the goals of NSS is to get you accustomed to working in different teams with different types of people. That and more was accomplished. Every single person I worked with directly made every project that much easier. Each and every one of them carried their own weight during our group projects!
    - I also want to say thanks to those I've spent the most time with over the past 15 weeks. I've made real friends that hopefully will last past this course!
      - You know who you are.
       - Except for you Sara, stay away from me.
          - Until I become your boss, in which case I will need hourly updates.

Give a ‚≠êÔ∏è if you like this project!
